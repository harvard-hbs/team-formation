# title: Team Formation as Constraint Satisfaction
# ---
# ## Problem Statement
#
# Dividing a large learning cohort into smaller teams for group work,
# discussion, or other activity is a common requirement in many learning
# contexts. It is easy to automate the formation of randomly assigned
# teams, but there can be rules, guidelines, and goals guiding the
# desired team composition to support learning objectives and other
# goals which can complicate manual and automated team creation.
#
# The approach described in this document provides a technical framework
# and implementation to support specifying team formation objectives in
# a declarative fashion and can automatically generate teams based on
# those objectives. There is also a description of how to measure and
# evaluate the created teams with respect to the specified objectives.
#
# The team formation objectives currently supported are team size and
# *diversification* and *clustering* around participant
# attributes. *Diversification* in this context is defined as the goal
# of having the distribution of a particular attribute value on each
# team reflect the distribution of that attribute value in the overall
# learning cohort. For example, if the overall learning cohort has 60%
# women and 40% men, a diversification goal on gender would attempt to
# achieve 60/40 female/male percentages on each team or, more
# specifically, to achieve the female/male participant counts that are
# closest to 60%/40% for the particular team size.
#
# *Clustering* is defined as the goal of having all team members share a
# particular attribute value. For example, if there is a `job_function`
# attribute with values of `Contributor`, `Manager`, and `Executive` a
# clustering goal would be to have each team contain participants with a
# single value of the `job_function` attribute to facilitate sharing
# of common experiences.
#
# Cluster variables can also be multi-valued indicated by a list of
# acceptable values for the participant. For example, if there is a
# `working_time` variable with hour ranges `00-05`, `05-10`, `10-15`,
# `15-20`, and `20-24`. A participant might have the values `["00-05",
# "20-24"]` indicating that both those time ranges are acceptable.
#
# In order to balance possibly conflicting objectives and goals of the
# team formation process we allow a weight to specified for each
# constraint to indicate the priority of the objective in relation
# to the others.
#
# ## Team Formation as Constraint Satisfaction using CP-SAT
#
# The problem of dividing participants into specified team sizes guided
# by diversity and clustering constraints can be stated as a [Constraint
# Satisfaction
# Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem)
# (CSP) with a set of variables with integer domains and constraints on
# the allowed combinations.
#
# There is a very efficient constraint solver that uses a variety of
# constraint solving techniques from the Google Operational Research
# team called [Google OR-Tools
# CP-SAT](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver) that
# we are using for this team assignment problem.
#
# The remainder of the document describes how to frame the team
# formation problem in the CP-SAT constraint model to be solved by the
# CP-SAT solver.
#
# ## Input Data
#
# The input to the team formation process is a set of participants with
# category-valued attributes, a target team size, and a set of
# constraints. The specification of the constraints is done with a
# dictionary with keys attribute names from the `participants` data frame as
# keys, a type of `diversify` or `cluster`, and a numeric `weight`.

        # size of each team. We now create an array of `num_teams` boolean
        # variables for each participant indicating whether that participant is
        # on the corresponding team. That array of team assignment variables is
        # put in the `parti_vars` map of each participant with the key `"team"`.
        #
        # We also add a constraint that the sum of each participant's team

        # and another constraint that the sum of each of the boolean variables for
        # each team must be equal to the team size to ensure the correct number
        # of participants in each team.

        # ### Team Attribute Value Count Variables
        #
        # Both the diversity and clustering constraints used for team formation
        # are defined in terms of team-by-team attribute value counts. We use a
        # `team_vars` map keyed by the attribute name with an array value
        # indexed by team; for each team there is an array indexed by attribute
        # value containing an integer variable representing the count of
        # that attribute value in the corresponding team.
        #
        # [Describe the mechanism for calculating the counts here.]
        #
        # The count of the number of females in team `0` is
        # `team_vars["gender"][0][0]`.

            for attr_name in self.attr_names
        }

        # ### Team Diversity and Clustering Constraints
        #
        # While all of the constraints defined so far have been all or nothing
        # and necessary for the proper functioning of the model (for example,
        # the setting of the participant attribute values and team sizes) the
        # diversity and clustering constraints will be defined with cost
        # functions that go up when the teams are farther away from the desired
        # state and equal to zero in the optimal situation. This allows for
        # over-constraining the model and letting the constraint engine take
        # into account the weights, providing a solution as close as we can get
        # given the participants and their provided attributes.
        #
        # #### Diversity
        #
        # We consider a team to be ideally diverse with respect to a particular
        # attribute when the distribution of each attribute value is the same in
        # the team as it is in the entire participant population. For example if
        # there are 60% women and 40% men in the full population, then a team
        # will be ideally diverse for the gender attribute if there are 60%
        # women and 40% men in that team. We turn those percentage values into
        # integer count targets for each attribute value in a particular-sized
        # team and define the cost function as the absolute value of the
        # difference from the target count, summed across all the variables and
        # multipled by the constraint weight.
        #
        # We define a `population_distribution` method that returns the
        # percentage of each attribute in the full population and then cache
        # that in a `population_dist` map for later use.
        #
        # The `value_count_targets` method uses the population distribution and
        # a team size to return the ideal count for each attribute value in a
        # team of a particular team size. It is important that rounding be used
        # when turning the percentage into a target value count (rather than
        # truncation) to ensure that the target counts add up to the team size.

        ## Cache attribute value distributions for diversity constraints.
        self.population_dist = {}
        for attr_name in self.attr_constraints:

                    attr_name
                )

        # #### Clustering
        #
        # We consider a team to be ideal with respect to an attribute clustering
        # constraint if all of the members of the team have a single value for
        # that attribute. For example, if the `job_function` attribute has
        # values `Contributor`, `Manager`, and `Executive` and a team's size is `3`,
        # then one ideal team configuration is to have all three team members
        # with a `job_function` value of `Contributor`. One way to test for that
        # situation is to compute the maximum of the team's attribute value
        # counts and take its maximum. If the maximum is equal to the team size,
        # then ideal clustering is achieved for the team. We define the
        # clustering cost function to be the difference between the maximum of a
        # team's attribute value counts as the team size, summed across all of
        # the teams and multiplied by the constraint weight.
        #
        # [Put some more details about the calculation mechanism here.]
        #
        # The cost constraints variables are kept in a flat list containing all
        # of the cost variables. We also calculate the population distributions
        # for the diversity constraints in this step.

        # of the attribute values across the entire population.

# solver, so that was used.

# First we create the `attr_vals` map from the attribute name to a list
# of boolean attributes, one for each attribute value.
